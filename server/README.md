# Stripe Payments with Node.js and Express

This repository provides a simple and secure way to handle payments using Stripe with Node.js and Express. Stripe is a popular payment processing platform that allows you to accept online payments seamlessly. This project integrates the Stripe API into a Node.js and Express application, providing a solid foundation for building a payment processing system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Stripe account (create one at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/))

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stripe-node-express-payments.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd stripe-node-express-payments
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up your environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
   - Add your Stripe API keys:

     ```env
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
     ```

     Replace `your_secret_key` and `your_public_key` with your actual Stripe API keys, which you can obtain from your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You should see a simple payment form.
